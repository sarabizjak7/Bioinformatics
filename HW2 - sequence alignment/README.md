# Homework 2

## Environment instructions

You will need Python 3.7 or higher. You will need to install `biopython` for accessing NCBI and `matplotlib` for plotting. You can also use `numpy`. You will need `jupyterlab` to open and run the notebook. You can install everything necessary by running
```
pip install numpy biopython matplotlib jupyterlab
```
Please do not use any other libraries, because the automatic grader will not recognize them and give you zero points. If you think some other library absolutely needs to be included, please reach out on Slack and we will discuss it there.

You can start the notebook by running
```
jupyter lab
```
and a browser window should pop open. You should now be all set.

Because this homework requires you to implement algorithms with high runtimes, you are permitted to use `numba` in this assignment. `numba` can speed up your code by a large factor. This is not a requirement or even a recommendation, because `numba` can be a pain to work with. However, you are welcome to take advantage of this if you so wish.
