# Homework 5

**Name**: Sara Bizjak

**Student number**: 27202020
    
## Submission checklist

- Check you filled out your name and student number at the top of the readme
- Check all your figures are named exactly as indicated in the instructions
- Check that your implemented function signatures match the instructions and docstring
- Where answers must be saved into a notebook variable, ensure that you have set these variables explicitly e.g. `x = 1.5`. Your notebook isn't actually run for grading, so assigning from a different variable e.g. `x = 5; result_variable = x` won't work

## Environment instructions

You will need Python 3.7 or higher. In this homework, we will use a variety of packages. We will use `scanpy` for loading and processing gene-expression data. We will use `matplotlib` and `seaborn` for plotting.  You can also use `numpy`, `scipy`, `pandas`, and `scikit-learn`. You can use either `openTSNE` or `umap-learn` for obtaining 2D visualizations of high-dimensional data. You will need `jupyterlab` to open and run the notebook.

Please do not use any other libraries, because the automatic grader will not recognize them and give you zero points. If you think some other library absolutely needs to be included, please reach out on Slack and we will discuss it there.

You can start the notebook by running
```
jupyter lab
```
and a browser window should pop open. You should now be all set.
